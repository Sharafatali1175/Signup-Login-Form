# Signup-Login-Form
Complete Signup Login Form in React js with LocalStorage. ( I created the Signup form where users can enter their name, email, and password. It includes form validation, password visibility toggle, and stores valid user data in localStorage. Upon successful signup, it navigates to the login page).
